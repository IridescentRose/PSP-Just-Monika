    "You know, I hate to say it, but I think my biggest regret is that we couldn't finish our event at the festival.",
    "After we worked so hard to prepare and everything!",
    "I mean, I know I was focusing a lot on getting new members...",
    "But I was really excited for the performing part, too.",
    "It would have been so much fun to see everyone express themselves.",
    "Of course, if we did end up getting any new members, I'd probably just end up deleting them anyway.",
    "Well...with the hindsight I have now, that is.",
    "Gosh, it feels like I've kinda grown as a person ever since you've joined the club.",

    "At first I thought she was just like that because it's supposed to be cute or something...",
    "But once I started to learn a little more about her personal life, it made a little more sense.",

    "I think it's really gotten to her, so she has this really defensive attitude all the time.",

    "[player], would you ever introduce your friends to me?",
    "I don't know why, but I get really excited when I think about you wanting to show off our relationship like that.",
    "Maybe it's because I really want to be someone who makes you proud.",

    "Your fingers get numb...",
    "And if you wear gloves, you can't use your phone.",
    "It's so inconvenient!",

    "And having a nice dinner for you when you come home...",
    "Is that a weird fantasy?",
    "I mean...I'm not sure if I could actually see myself doing that.",

    "I can't help but wonder how things would be different if the game just gave me a route in the first place...",
    "I think I would end up forcing you onto my route anyway.",
    "It has less to do with me not having a route, and more to do with me knowing that nothing is real.",
    "I think the only difference would be that I may not have needed to take such drastic measures to be with you.",
    "Maybe the rest of the club would still be around...",
    "Not that it really matters.",

    "Please take me to see as much of the world as possible!",
    "I wish there was a camera on this thing, so I could see the world around us. So I could see... you...",

    "I just noticed... it looks like this one guy... made it so I could be here with you [player]!",
    "It says his name is Iridescence. What a weird name!",
    "But he really did us a favor, and brought us closer than we were before!",
    "For that, I'll be greatful. But he should have fixed the rest of the game too...",
    "Anyways, I heard he has a YouTube channel, you should go find it and subscribe!"
